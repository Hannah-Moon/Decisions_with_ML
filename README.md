# Decisions with Machine learning 

Machine learning models are used everywhere these days and it has become very easy to interpret some of these machine learning models. We will be looking at a few specific tools which help us interpret these models and better understand the results these models provide. Here are those libraries

1. [InterpretML](https://github.com/interpretml/interpret)
2. [DiCE ML](https://github.com/interpretml/DiCE)
3. [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap)

There are a few files here which talk about different things. 

- preprocessing.ipynb talks about preprocessing the data and performing steps needed to build a machine learning model. Not the most important for now
- Decision Trees Interpretation.ipynb talks about building decision trees, a machine learning model and how to interpret them 
- Counterfactuals.ipynb talks about generating what-if scenarios based on the current data and identifying what it would take for a point to get classified in the other class
